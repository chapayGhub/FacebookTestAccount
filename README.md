You may have the same problem. You made a great application, and your
application publishes contents to Facebook, so you created a lots of
test cases which publish contents using your own Facebook account, and
then your account is banned since Facebook considers that you are
spamming.

In such a case, Facebook askes you to create a test user account but
not to use your own account. Facebook's API documentation is available
at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/test_users/ . All you need to
do is to visit the API endpoints with specific GET parameters.

The project aims to provide tools to make it easier to manipulate
Facebook's test user APIs. The project includes implementation with
Python, Ruby, PHP, Objective-C and JavaScript programming languages.

Enjoy it!
